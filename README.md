BertScout2017 Pit Scouting

This is an Android Studio app for FIRST Robotics competition scouting to run on a Kindle Fire. It is written for team 133 B.E.R.T. (Bonny Eagle Robotics Team) in Standish, Maine, USA.

This app has Stand Scouting, for tracking matches, scoring, robot abilities and limitations. It also has Pit Scouting, for pre-game tracking of what features other robots have or don't have. It will sync the data from multiple Kindles together and redistribute the info to them all.

Work in progress!!! This is just a framework for holding actual game information once it is released in January 2017. This app will be heavily modified at that point.
